# AI Coding Assistant Migration Summary

## ✅ Migration Completed Successfully

### Project Overview
A clean, dedicated AI coding assistant project has been successfully created at `../dart-ai-coding-assistant` with all accounting-specific functionality removed.

### What Was Migrated
1. **Core AI Coding Assistant**: Complete `bin/ai_coding_assistant.dart` with coding-focused system prompt
2. **MCP Infrastructure**: All non-accounting MCP servers:
   - Context Manager MCP Server
   - Dart Development MCP Server  
   - Terminal Command MCP Server
   - Puppeteer MCP Server
3. **Configuration**: Updated MCP server configuration
4. **Dependencies**: Clean pubspec.yaml with only development-related packages

### What Was Excluded (Accounting-Specific)
- Accountant MCP Server (`mcp_server_accountant.dart`)
- Accounting-specific dependencies (archive, crypto, dotenv, get_it, json_annotation)
- Accounting models and services
- Financial reporting functionality

### Project Structure
```
dart-ai-coding-assistant/
├── bin/ai_coding_assistant.dart     # Main coding assistant
├── config/mcp_servers.json          # MCP configuration
├── mcp/                            # MCP servers (non-accounting)

├── pubspec.yaml                    # Clean dependencies
└── README.md                       # Project documentation
```

### Key Changes Made
1. **System Prompt**: Updated to focus purely on coding assistance
2. **Dependencies**: Removed all accounting-specific packages
3. **Configuration**: Clean MCP setup without accounting servers
4. **Documentation**: Comprehensive README and migration documentation

### Testing Status
- ✅ Dependency resolution: `dart pub get` completes successfully
- ✅ Project structure: All directories created correctly
- ✅ Configuration: MCP servers configured properly
- ❌ MCP server testing: Requires manual verification (expected timeout in automated testing)

### Next Steps
1. **Manual Testing**: Verify MCP servers start correctly
2. **Function Testing**: Test coding assistance functionality
3. **Enhancements**: Add more coding-specific capabilities
4. **Documentation**: Create usage examples and tutorials

### Crash Recovery
If migration was interrupted, the comprehensive `MIGRATION_TODO.md` file provides step-by-step recovery instructions. The original accounting project remains intact for reference.
