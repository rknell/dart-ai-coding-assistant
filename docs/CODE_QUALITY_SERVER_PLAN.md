  - [ ] Hardcoded secrets detection
  - [ ] Insecure random number generation
  - [ ] Path traversal vulnerabilities
  - [ ] SQL injection patterns (if applicable)
  - [ ] XSS patterns in templates
- [ ] Create vulnerability severity scoring
- [ ] Add remediation suggestions

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- ‚úÖ Scans for 10+ common security issues
- ‚úÖ Integrates with pub.dev security data
- ‚úÖ Provides severity scores (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
- ‚úÖ Includes remediation guidance
- ‚úÖ Handles offline scenarios gracefully

---

### Phase 3: Code Complexity Analysis (Week 3)
**Goal**: Implement complexity metrics and code smell detection

#### Tasks:
- [ ] Implement `analyze_complexity` tool
- [ ] Add cyclomatic complexity calculation
- [ ] Add cognitive complexity metrics
- [ ] Detect code smells:
  - [ ] Large classes/methods
  - [ ] Deep nesting
  - [ ] Duplicate code blocks
  - [ ] Dead code detection
  - [ ] Unused imports/variables
- [ ] Set configurable complexity thresholds
- [ ] Generate refactoring suggestions

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- ‚úÖ Calculates cyclomatic and cognitive complexity
- ‚úÖ Detects 8+ types of code smells
- ‚úÖ Provides refactoring suggestions
- ‚úÖ Configurable thresholds per project
- ‚úÖ Clear explanations for each metric

---

### Phase 4: Performance & Dependency Analysis (Week 4)
**Goal**: Add performance profiling and dependency analysis

#### Tasks:
- [ ] Implement `analyze_dependencies` tool
- [ ] Check for outdated dependencies
- [ ] License compliance scanning
- [ ] Dependency security analysis
- [ ] Add `profile_performance` tool for:
  - [ ] Build time analysis
  - [ ] Bundle size analysis
  - [ ] Memory usage patterns
  - [ ] CPU usage hotspots
- [ ] Generate performance recommendations

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- ‚úÖ Analyzes dependency health and security
- ‚úÖ Provides license compliance reports
- ‚úÖ Identifies performance bottlenecks
- ‚úÖ Suggests optimization opportunities
- ‚úÖ Exports results in multiple formats

---

### Phase 5: Integration & Polish (Final Week)
**Goal**: Complete integration and advanced features

#### Tasks:
- [ ] Implement result export (JSON, XML, HTML)
- [ ] Add configuration file support
- [ ] Create comprehensive documentation
- [ ] Add IDE integration examples
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Add caching for expensive operations
- [ ] Create CI/CD integration examples
- [ ] Final testing and bug fixes

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- ‚úÖ Multiple export formats available
- ‚úÖ Configurable via config files
- ‚úÖ IDE integration examples
- ‚úÖ CI/CD ready
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive documentation
- ‚úÖ Performance optimized

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Week 1**: Focus on Phase 1 - get basic linting working
2. **Validate early**: Test with real projects after each phase
3. **Iterate based on feedback**: Adjust requirements as we learn
4. **Document as we go**: Keep examples and docs updated

This incremental approach allows us to deliver value early and adjust based on real-world usage!
