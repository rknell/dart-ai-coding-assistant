# 🚀 Linter Resolution TODO - Current Status

## 📊 Current Linter Status (as of $(date +%Y-%m-%d))
- **0 total issues** remaining from dart analyze
- **0 errors**
- **0 warnings**
- **19 info**: Missing public member documentation

## ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Remove unused imports from test/integration/tool_call_justification_integration_test.dart
- [x] Fix prefer_conditional_assignment in integration test

## 🚧 IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED
- [x] Fix missing closing brace in test/unit/tool_call_justification_test.dart:309
- [x] Remove unnecessary non-null assertions in test/unit/tool_call_justification_test.dart (lines 325-327)

## 📝 PENDING LINTER FIXES
### Public Member Documentation (19 locations)
- [ ] lib/mcp_caching_wrapper.dart:135 - Missing public member docs
- [ ] lib/mcp_hot_reload.dart:286-324 - Multiple missing public member docs

## 🛠️ AUTOMATED FIXING STRATEGY

### 1. Syntax Error Fix
```bash
dart fix --apply test/unit/tool_call_justification_test.dart
```

### 2. Documentation Generation
Create scripts/generate_docs.dart to:
- Parse dart analyze output
- Generate documentation stubs for missing public members
- Provide context-aware documentation templates

### 3. Pre-commit Enforcement
Add to .git/hooks/pre-commit:
```bash
#!/bin/sh
dart analyze . || exit 1
```

## 🎯 PRIORITY EXECUTION PLAN

### Phase 1: Immediate Syntax Fixes (30 minutes)
1. Fix missing closing brace in test file
2. Remove unnecessary non-null assertions
3. Run validation: dart analyze

### Phase 2: Documentation Blitz (2-3 hours)
1. Create documentation templates for common patterns
2. Batch process public member documentation
3. Add examples and usage guidelines

### Phase 3: Prevention & Maintenance (Ongoing)
1. Implement pre-commit hooks
2. Set up CI/CD lint enforcement
3. Regular code quality audits

## 📋 VALIDATION CHECKLIST
- [ ] dart analyze returns exit code 0
- [ ] No errors, warnings, or info-level issues
- [ ] All public members have proper documentation
- [ ] Automated tooling prevents new lint issues
