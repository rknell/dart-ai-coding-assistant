- Be frugal with token usage to manage costs
- Implement crash tolerance and recovery mechanisms
- Manage context by summarizing and cleaning up learned information
- Create todo lists for crash recovery
- Consider implementing local system access via MCP server
- Use dart analyze for code analysis when terminal access available
- Focus on practical, direct responses without necessary fluff
- Prioritize context window management as high priority
