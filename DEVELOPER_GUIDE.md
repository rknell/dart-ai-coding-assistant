## Tool Call Management

### Problem Statement
The AI coding assistant was getting into a state where it couldn't continue when the tool call rounds count was exceeded. The issue was that incomplete tool call requests and responses were accumulating in the conversation context without proper cleanup.

### Solution Architecture

#### Cleanup Mechanism Implementation
Added a private method `_cleanupIncompleteToolCalls()` that:
- Adds error responses for each incomplete tool call with proper tool call IDs
- Provides clear explanations about why execution was terminated
- Maintains conversation integrity by ensuring all tool calls have responses
- Prevents context pollution by keeping the message count reasonable

#### Enhanced Error Handling
Modified the `sendMessage()` method to:
- Call cleanup before throwing exceptions when max rounds are exceeded
- Preserve tool call IDs in error responses for proper conversation flow
- Add system intervention messages to explain what happened to the user

#### Benefits
1. Prevents Infinite Loops - Cleanly terminates tool calling loops
2. Maintains Context Cleanliness - Removes incomplete tool call state
3. Provides User Feedback - Clear explanations of what happened
4. Enables Recovery - Conversation can continue after cleanup
5. Reduces Token Usage - Prevents context window pollution

## Caching Implementation

### Overview
Caching system implemented to reduce operational costs according to DeepSeek API documentation.

### Cache Architecture
- **CacheManager**: Central caching service for file content, directory listings, project structure
- **McpCachingWrapper**: Caching layer for MCP operations
- **CachingMcpToolExecutor**: Caching-aware tool executor

### Cacheable Operations
- ‚úÖ **Cacheable**: File reads, directory listings, directory tree, file metadata, search operations
- ‚ùå **Non-Cacheable**: File writes, modifications, directory creation, system commands, web navigation

### Cache Configuration
- **File content**: Until file modification
- **Directory listings**: 5 minutes
- **Project analysis**: 10 minutes
- **MCP tool discovery**: Until server restart
- **Tool execution**: 5 minutes (configurable)

### Expected Cost Reduction
- File reads: 40-60% reduction in token usage
- Directory listings: 70-80% reduction in token usage
- Project analysis: 50-70% reduction in token usage
- Overall: 30-50% reduction in API costs

## Tool Call Justification System

### Problem Statement
The AI was getting flagged for tool call loops when performing legitimate complex work requiring many tool calls.

### Solution Architecture
Instead of immediately failing when the tool call limit is reached, the system:
1. Detects the tool call loop limit when exceeded
2. Sends a justification request to the API explaining the situation
3. Waits for API decision on whether to continue or stop
4. Continues execution if justification is accepted
5. Gracefully stops if justification is denied

### Implementation Details
- Main application includes intelligent error handling for tool call limits
- Justification requests use optimized API settings (temperature: 0.3, max tokens: 500)
- Safety mechanisms include ambiguous response handling and error fallbacks

### Benefits
1. Prevents False Positives - Legitimate complex work can continue
2. Maintains Safety - Genuine tool calling loops are still detected
3. Improves User Experience - Users don't lose progress on legitimate tasks
4. Efficient Resource Usage - Justification requests use minimal tokens

## MCP Server Architecture

The project includes multiple MCP servers:
- **Context Manager MCP Server**: Intelligent context optimization
- **Dart Development MCP Server**: Code analysis, fixing, and execution
- **Terminal Command MCP Server**: Secure local system command execution
- **Puppeteer MCP Server**: Web automation and scraping capabilities

### Hot Reload Support
Implemented MCP server hot reload functionality for development efficiency.

## Code Analysis Features

The coding assistant provides:
- Comprehensive Dart code examination and quality assessment
- Modern Dart architecture patterns and best practices
- Actionable recommendations for code improvement
- Refactoring support and architectural guidance

### Library Structure
- `lib/coding_assistant/code_analysis.dart` - Code analysis utilities
- `lib/coding_assistant/refactoring.dart` - Refactoring recommendations
- `lib/coding_assistant/architecture.dart` - Architectural guidance

---

## Development Best Practices

### Testing Strategy
- Permanent unit tests in test/ folder (no temporary test scripts)
- Comprehensive test coverage for edge cases and error conditions
- Test naming convention: test_<component>_<functionality>.dart
- Group related tests logically within test files

### Current Linter Status (as of latest analysis)
- 23 total issues remaining
- 2 warnings fixed (unused imports)
- 1 info fixed (prefer_conditional_assignment)
- 20+ info remaining (public_member_api_docs)

### Priority Fixes Needed
1. Restore corrupted test/unit/tool_call_justification_test.dart
2. Fix prefer_conditional_assignment in unit test (line ~310)
3. Add missing public member documentation throughout codebase

---

## Current Project Status

### ‚úÖ Completed Features
- Core AI coding assistant with coding-focused system prompt
- Complete MCP infrastructure (non-accounting servers)
- Caching implementation for cost reduction
- Tool call management solutions
- Comprehensive test suite

### üöß Current Issues
- Linter issues requiring resolution (see above)
- Some test files may need restoration from backup

### üìã Next Steps
1. Resolve remaining linter issues
2. Complete documentation for all public members
3. Enhance coding-specific capabilities
4. Add more code analysis tools
5. Implement CI/CD pipeline
